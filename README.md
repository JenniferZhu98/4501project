TAXI vs. Ride Share Data for the NEW YORK METRO AREA

Purpose:
The following code is utilized in IEOR 4501 Tools for Analaytics course at Columbia Univeristy. The implementation of this code is divided into four parts. Each part is needed to perform the required analysis of the data sets provided by the project task.

Part I- This section is devoted to Data Processing. The code loads data for Taxi Data, Uber Ride Sharing Data, and Weather Data for the New York area from 2009-2015. Implementing this section of the code will also clean and filter the relevant data, removing any unnecessary data and adding necessary information needed for follow  on analysis.

Part II- This section is devoted to Storing Data. The code populates a SQLite database with tables generated from the datasets from Part I into a these tables which will be used for follow on data analysis. 

Part III- This sect:ion is devoted to Extracting Data. The code answers specific questions posed by the Project tasks by querying the data and returning an understanding of the data to the user.

Part IV- This section is devoted to Data Visualization. The code presents six different visualizations of the data, offering the user easy and quick intepretation of the data.
